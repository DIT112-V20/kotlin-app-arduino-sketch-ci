# CI for Kotlin app and Arduino ![Android CI] ![Arduino CI]

This repository includes a sample project Continuous Integration setup
for a system that is made up of a Kotlin/Android application and an Arduino sketch.

GitHub Actions is used ton run the CI pipeline since it reliably supports launching
an Android emulator (AVD) for running instrumented tests.
